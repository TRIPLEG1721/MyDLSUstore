1.  Setting up the project:
    Make sure you have already installed Visual Studio Code, XAMPP, and php. Run the command pip install requirements.txt to get distributables and extensions           necessary to run the local website. Create a folder inside the following path: "C:\xampp\htdocs" name it into "mydlsustoreAPP". Download the rar file                 "mydlsustoreAPP" and extract the file on the FOLDER created. The following file path location shall then be: "C:\xampp\htdocs\mydlsustoreAPP".

2.  Install XAMPP, PHP and PHPMyAdmin :
    Firstly, install PHP on your system. You can do this by installing a WAMP (Windows), MAMP (Mac), or LAMP (Linux) stack. Once PHP is installed, you can install       PHPMyAdmin.

3.  Create a database:
    Open PHPMyAdmin and create a new database, in this instance for the file to work create database name "addtocart". You can do this by clicking on the "New"           button on the left-hand side menu and entering the name of your database.

5.  Create a connection:
    Create a connection between your PHP code and the database you just created. To do this, you'll need to create a PHP file that includes the code to connect to       your database. This code typically includes the server name, username, password, and database name.
